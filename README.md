Minecraft ores detection using YOLOv4-tiny

Summary:

In this project, a real-time block detection system was implemented for the video game Minecraft using the YOLOv4 neural network architecture and Python. The training and testing process of the detection model was carried out in a Windows environment with Visual Studio 2019 and TensorFlow. Additionally, the code was adapted to work in a Linux environment using WSL2.

Project highlights:

Configuration and preparation of the development environment, including the installation of necessary packages and libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Darknet.
Adaptation of the real-time detection script to work with transparent images and a always-on-top window, allowing for a better user experience when playing Minecraft.
Implementation of YOLOv4 in TensorFlow, allowing for the utilization of GPU acceleration capabilities and simplifying the training and testing process.
Use of custom training techniques and hyperparameter optimization to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the detection model.
Effective collaboration with an AI virtual assistant to solve problems and develop solutions throughout the project.
This project demonstrates solid skills in the development of artificial intelligence and deep learning-based applications, as well as experience in adapting solutions to different environments and platforms.
